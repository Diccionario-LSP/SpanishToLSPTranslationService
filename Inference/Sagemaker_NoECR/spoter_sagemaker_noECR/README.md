We tried runing train.ipynb in sagemaker jupyter lab and it works, but we do not know how to follow the pipeline of sagemaker.

Note: To train a model you have to use "ConnectingPoints" repository and follow the readme of this respository, or download our preprocessed Hdf5 files from our google drive (this will be added in the future) and modify the dataset path in the config.json of this folder.
